# Forsk_CDR_Project
## Telecom CDR Data Analytics Project

**Introduction:**
The project is a real time Telecom Call Data Records analytics project, the CDR(Call Data Record) file which is a .csv file is in raw format (contains raw data consisting of date, time, device info etc.) does not contain column name and having a total of 435 columns in total. Also the information is spread across multiple columns. The client’s requirement includes- to develop an UI for data visualization which should contain three tabs/sections namely- “Call Analytics Tool”, “Device Analytics Tool”, and “Service Analytics Tool” which will give the information about calls, devices and the services according to the constraints in the form of graph and pie charts respectively.

**Related Work:**
1.	Understanding client’s requirements.
2.	Analysing the Data.
3.	Filtering the Data.
4.	Knowing of implementation requirements.
5.	Visualizing the data by graph, card and table.

**Your work:**
My function was to work on Client Project Opportunities with Forsk Coding School acting as a Project Guide and PMC (Project Management Consultant). Under this project we were trained by Forsk Coding School to being carried out this project. Some of my works are given below:
1.	Filtering the data in accordance to clients requirements. In this step my mentor from Forsk School helps me which data is to be filtered and also how to do it and I carried out the work.
2.	Then I was trained by mentor to use DASH ( a popular framework for building ML & data science web apps by Plotly). By using DASH I created a wireframe to make Web Based UI to Visualize the data analysis. 
3.	With a training by my mentor from Forsk taught us how to get that graph, card and table representation in dash and also about pie chart representation. So I used it to make area graph and pie chart out of the data.
4.	Then I applied minimal CSS on the app to make it look clean and good for the user.
5.	Every day we used to get homework from Forsk in order to complete the project by which we learned more daily.

**Implementation:**
Implementation goes in such a way that users find it a way easier to get the information they want about the calls, services, and devices to their needs, in accordance with the needs of the users’ graph, cards and tables gets updated.
The implementation of the project is mentioned below:
In the process of the SDLC(software development life cycle) I followed the below mentioned phases: 

Step 1: Analysis Phase – understand the dataset very clearly, filter irrelevant and relevant data.
Step 2: Design Phase – create wireframe, rough sketch of how the s/w will look like, charts/graphs. 
Step 3: Research & Learning Phase – most important phase, search for the client’s needs and choices. Also learning the use of DASH. 
Step 4: Development Phase – UI design, UI expectations for input and UI expectations for output using DASH and other python libraries. 
Step 5: Back-end Development Phase – creating a server side web application.


**Results:**
We get a good looking application where we can work out which different analytics. An UI is created displaying 3 tabs: “call analytics tool”, “device analytics tool”, “service analytics tool”. The “call analytics tool” tab will give the information about the calls, also the information are graphically represented (weekly, daily, hourly), more information in the form of cards (incoming, outgoing, missed calls) and data table, both of the latter tabs (device and service analytics tool) will unfold the information regarding the devices and services respectively in the form of pie charts.

**Software Improvements:**
We can add on more features like changing background color and giving background image to cards to make the UI more attractive and appealing. One or the other cloud services can be used in order to enhance storage in future.

**Conclusions and Future work:**
The goal of this Python Project was to visualize the analytics for Call Data, Device Data and Service Data which included divided part of the raw dataset into 3 different datasets, and to build a server based web page, as per the requirements UI should have a Call Data Analytics to generate a Line Graph based on the start date and end date, group and based on Hourly, Weekly and Daily data and the user should be able to select any start date and end date, group and type of graph and based on that we need to show the graph. This project internship boosted up my knowledge in data analytics with real-time dataset and I am interested to work with more likewise data sets in future.
